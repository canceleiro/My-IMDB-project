# My IMDB project
### by Javier Alonso

In this project I try to apply all my Data Science knowledge into the  IMDB movie database. 
This database was downloaded from IMDB on 2020/05/25 but today, three days after, they have changed all the system for retrieving the data, so I won´t be able to upgrade easily the project with new data.

## Installations required

The project contains a jupyter notebook, so that´s the only necessary software you´d need. Be sure to have installed on it numpy, pandas,  matplotlib and seaborn


## File descriptions

There are different Jupyter Notebooks for each part of the project (EDA, recommendation system, clustering, predictions,...)
